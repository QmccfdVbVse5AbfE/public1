Hi There,

These are some projects and homeworks I have worked on. The Python file is to my final prject for Data Science. 
It runs several different analysis on the United States President's State of the Union Addresses. 
The purpose of this project was to see if President's fund what they discuss.

The zip file is for my final project for my software engineering class. It is a search engine for plants. 

The CNN folder has code from my most recent homework assignment-where I built a CNN to classify images into 15 different categories. I ended up with a 72 percent accuracy.
